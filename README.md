# Always Mate
<img src="icon.png" width="300">

A simple Cult of the Lamb mod that changes Mating Tents so that two followers will always have an 100% chance of laying an egg, no RNG involved (depending on the settings)

Requires [COTL_API](https://thunderstore.io/c/cult-of-the-lamb/p/xhayper/COTL_API/) and [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) to work. I recommend using [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/cult-of-the-lamb/p/ebkr/r2modman/) to install this and many other Cult of the Lamb mods!
